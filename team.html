				David attended Olin College of Engineering where he created and taught the school's first student led course - on web development and entreprenuership. After graduating he worked at Twitter for two and a half years, before leaving to found the nonprofit <a href="http://schoolshaped.org">School Shaped</a> followed by the for-profit <a href="http://classadoo.com">Classadoo</a>. In 2015 he was given the opportunity to teach a two week intersession course at Design Tech High School. He decided to teach a condensed Olin College course and see how the 9th and 10th graders would do. In short, he was blown away. Every student team founded a profitable business and most evaluated the course as one of the best they had ever taken. The second iteration of the course (which had many repeat participants) went similarly well. David realized he needed to get the course out to more students, and thus, Launch Camp was born.
