						Launch Alpha was a 10 week pilot program which helped 6th-8th graders at Claremont Middle School found their own businesses - from product ideation to marketing, selling and manufacturing. 
					</h3>
					<h4>					
						 Launch Alpha was also the first Launch program exclusively targeting low-income students. We see entrepreneurship as a way to engage and empower students from all backgrounds, but especially those from low-income families. Launch Alpha provided tools, encouragement and strategies, but each student earned their own first sale, including the money it made and the confidence it built. We wanted our students to know that their success isn't dependent on the bias or charity of others. We created experiences to demonstrate that financial success, at least, was achievable through their own grit, collaboration and willingness to fail.
					</h4>
					<h3>
						We see the power of our program from the first sale.
					</h3>
					<h4>
						Denise was one of our most reluctant students. She was a shy, goofy and difficult 8th grader who hid her permission slip from us to avoid selling on field trips downtown. It took four weeks and many phone calls home before we convinced her to try to sell one of her early projects. On this trip, after three failed sales attempts, when she was about to give up for good, she finally made her first sale - $5 for a wooden post card. Two minutes later she was on the phone with her mom, bragging about her sale while inventing a homework assignment for herself so she could follow up on a new design for a customer. That one sale convinced Denise that her work actually mattered, not just for a grade but for a world of random strangers. She became uniquely engaged. Since then Denise has come in early, worked late and learned new tools faster than any student in the class. We want to get experiences like this to more students across the country.

												Identifying Resources
											</h3>								
											<h4>
												On the first day of class, students worked together to ideate on products. We wanted them to forget about making the next Facebook, and think about what they could sell this week.
												The first step of the exercise is to exhaust categories of resources: goods, materials, tools, skills, and people. After a few rounds, students circulate and combine their resources into product ideas.

												The Power of the Sale
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Not every student creates a compelling product after four classes, but we wanted to get them selling right away. To kickstart their sales, we gave them each some simple wooden postcards sporting the Oakland logo. Then, the students split into teams and searched downtown Rockridge for customers. In 30 minutes, each team made at least $10, and several made over $30. Once every student had money in their hands, they finally believed us: the class was about real-world skills that they can use right away.

											<h4>

												We also made a strong tradition of daily reflection, making sure students were thoughtful about what worked for their team and what needed to change.

												Armed with new optimism for their sales skills, students returned to the tools with increased motivation. The teams continued the postcard project with their own illustrations and started on entirely new products. They designed gifts with inspirational quotes, postcards with team logos, shirts with emojis and more. Students loved showing off their ideas and were quick to take them back to the streets of Oakland.

											<h3>
												Negotiation
											</h3>
											<h4>
												One thing students love is offering discounts. Customers should never find this out, but if they seem friendly, they can usually name their price. When the kids first approached retail shops, they thought offers of $200 for 200 post cards were great, until they realized the amount of work it would take. Students learned to negotiate carefully when they were investing so much time, and began work on large scale production.

											<h3>
												Efficiency
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Selling one item for $10 was a great feeling, but bulk discounts started eating into students time. One student calculated her hourly rate at $8/hour after she dropped her price to $2 per card. But because their processes were repeatable, they quickly found the value of batching the laser-cutting so they could walk away while machines did the work.

												The Future
											</h3>
											<h4>
												Ultimately, Launch Camp is a brief part of our students' education, but we believe it is one that stands out and teaches unique lessons. In their other classes, students form the bedrock for a better life in the long-term. With Launch, we try to create experiences that are relevant for the present, teaching students to better their lives, discover motivation, and make a difference - today.
